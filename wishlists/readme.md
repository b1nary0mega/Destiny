Welcome to my public wishlist section.

My own thoughts/opinions on certain rolls. Lists were built using [Wishlist Manager](https://wishlists.littlelight.club/#/).

This is my primary wishlist, replacing the default DIM [Voltron List](https://github.com/48klocs/dim-wish-list-sources/blob/master/voltron.txt).
