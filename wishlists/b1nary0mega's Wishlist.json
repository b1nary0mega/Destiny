The former ensures that you receive Restoration when you grant an ally Restoration, while the latter improves the support frame boost aspect, making it last far longer. Both are strong, but Physic stands out as the top choice in column three. The enhanced version of the perk, available on a crafted No Hesitation, will give Restoration x2, making you basically invulnerable to all but the heaviest sustained damage. Otherwise Demolitionist and Overflow are both useful just for ensuring you can keep firing as long as possible without stopping to reload. In the fourth column there is the aforementioned Circle of Life and also the reliably good Incandescent, which interacts well with Solar subclasses. There is also a surprising niche choice: Attrition Orbs. This generally bad perk creates orbs when damaging an enemy, which is nice, but they usually pop out of that enemy's head, which is bad as you don't really want to have to run over there and collect them. On a support frame, though, it also periodically creates orbs when healing allies, making the perk much more useful.",

Healing abilities can swing matches, but No Hesitation has to deal damage to use its healing, while a healing rift or grenade does not. That said it should excel in situations where two teams take potshots at each other before engaging. Think of it like Osteo Striga, putting constant pressure on enemies with a stream of tracking bullets. That's why I like Circle of Life here, to maximise the uptime of the support frame damage boost. Beyond that Physic will always be strong, while Overflow lets you keep up the pressure with an endless stream of suppressing fire. There's also a niche case here for Disruption Break, which inflicts a huge debuff against kinetic damage when breaking a player's shields, playing into the teamshooting playstyle this weapon encourages. Finally I've put all my barrels and magazines into extra range, because you're going to be hip shooting this gun a lot, and you're going to want to be able to do that from as far away as possible.",

Everyone else, especially strand hunters, will probably be looking for Slice, to debuff enemies and generate tangles, partnered with a reliable damage perk like One For All or Desperate Measures. One For All is particularly good here, due to the splash damage ensuring you are frequently hitting multiple targets.

To that end, Smallbore is the best barrel, but arguments can be made for Hammer-Forged Rifling or Chambered Compensator. Accurized Rounds is your best magazine as Ricochet Rounds aren’t available here. Steady Rounds could be a solid second pick if you go with Hammer-Forged Rifling. Perk 1 has Rapid-Hit or To the Pain, both of which are excellent stat boosting perks. Rapid-Hit will help keep your follow up shots on target, but To the Pain boosts aim assist and handling for taking damage, so up to you what feels right. Perk 2 has the aforementioned damage boosting perks, but also rolls with Eye of the Storm for a solid dueling experience, especially with To the Pain. Desperate Measures is probably the best damage boosting perk as it doesn’t require a Stasis ability kill to get max effectiveness.",

The former ensures that you receive Restoration when you grant an ally Restoration, while the latter improves the support frame boost aspect, making it last far longer. Both are strong, but Physic stands out as the top choice in column three. The enhanced version of the perk, available on a crafted No Hesitation, will give Restoration x2, making you basically invulnerable to all but the heaviest sustained damage. Otherwise Demolitionist and Overflow are both useful just for ensuring you can keep firing as long as possible without stopping to reload. In the fourth column there is the aforementioned Circle of Life and also the reliably good Incandescent, which interacts well with Solar subclasses. There is also a surprising niche choice: Attrition Orbs. This generally bad perk creates orbs when damaging an enemy, which is nice, but they usually pop out of that enemy's head, which is bad as you don't really want to have to run over there and collect them. On a support frame, though, it also periodically creates orbs when healing allies, making the perk much more useful.",

Healing abilities can swing matches, but No Hesitation has to deal damage to use its healing, while a healing rift or grenade does not. That said it should excel in situations where two teams take potshots at each other before engaging. Think of it like Osteo Striga, putting constant pressure on enemies with a stream of tracking bullets. That's why I like Circle of Life here, to maximise the uptime of the support frame damage boost. Beyond that Physic will always be strong, while Overflow lets you keep up the pressure with an endless stream of suppressing fire. There's also a niche case here for Disruption Break, which inflicts a huge debuff against kinetic damage when breaking a player's shields, playing into the teamshooting playstyle this weapon encourages. Finally I've put all my barrels and magazines into extra range, because you're going to be hip shooting this gun a lot, and you're going to want to be able to do that from as far away as possible.",

The damage combination starts with the key perk, Auto-Loading Holster. Firing then stowing Lost Signal will reload after 2.5 seconds, the point here is to fire Lost Signal at the target then switch to another weapon to deal some damage then switch back. Due to how Lost Signal operates, the damage ticks away from its shots so it’s constantly doing damage while the Fireteam hits it with another weapon. Then when switching back, Lost Signal is ready to go again. Vorpal Weapon then comes in for this god roll for its 15 percent damage increase to higher-ranking combatants. This extra damage makes Lost Signal a great choice for taking on even the toughest challenges as it will consistently do tick damage when landing hits and then reload itself awaiting its next volley.",

For our barrel, we will want Hammer-Forged Rifling, and for our magazine, Ricochet Rounds. Hammer-Forged Rifling will significantly increase our effective range with the weapon, allowing you to get the jump on opponents from further away. Ricochet Rounds will also increase our range as well as stability, with the added benefit of being able to bounce our shots off of surfaces. In perk column 1, we want Demolitionist to create grenade ability energy upon kills with the weapon. In column 2, we will pick Tap the Trigger. Upon pulling the trigger, you will instantly experience increased stability and accuracy, perfect for nailing those distant headshots on your opponents.",

The main perk combination is where Lost Signal shines and works perfectly for controlling areas causing big amounts of damage to enemies who run into its pools or from sticking a direct hit. The damage combination starts with the key perk, Auto-Loading Holster. Firing then stowing Lost Signal will reload after 2.5 seconds, the point here is to fire Lost Signal at the target then switch to another weapon to deal some damage then switch back. Due to how Lost Signal operates, the damage ticks away from its shots so it’s constantly doing damage while the Fireteam hits it with another weapon. Then when switching back, Lost Signal is ready to go again. Vorpal Weapon then comes in for this god roll for its 15 percent damage increase to higher-ranking combatants. This extra damage makes Lost Signal a great choice for taking on even the toughest challenges as it will consistently do tick damage when landing hits and then reload itself awaiting its next volley.",

This Scintillation PvE god roll taps into some of the best features a Linear Fusion Rifle can carry. An essential perk to start with is Arrowhead Brake, which ensures Recoil reaches maximum efficiency at 100 and keeps shots vertical after each round fired. The added Handling ensures Scintillation is ready to go quickly when called into action. Add Ionized Battery in the second slot to increase the Magazine size. This extra shot is an essential part of building this god roll when combined with the main perk set. The main perk set is a tried and tested powerful combination in the current sandbox that can easily take down some of the toughest enemies. Start with Envious Assassin which has the potential to double the Magazine size and number of shots carried. This means with the Backup Mag mod and Ionized Battery, the total shot count can reach 14. Throw on Bait and Switch for the final perk to have the potential setup of a 30 percent damage increase for almost every shot. This then ties in perfectly with the Veist Stinger Origin Trait which can then further Reload the Magazine as the shot count gets lower. This god roll means Scintillation can do some serious damage when it all comes together.",

This Scintillation PvE god roll taps into some of the best features a Linear Fusion Rifle can carry. An essential perk to start with is Arrowhead Brake, which ensures Recoil reaches maximum efficiency at 100 and keeps shots vertical after each round fired. The added Handling ensures Scintillation is ready to go quickly when called into action. Add Ionized Battery in the second slot to increase the Magazine size. This extra shot is an essential part of building this god roll when combined with the main perk set. The main perk set is a tried and tested powerful combination in the current sandbox that can easily take down some of the toughest enemies. Start with Envious Assassin which has the potential to double the Magazine size and number of shots carried. This means with the Backup Mag mod and Ionized Battery, the total shot count can reach 14. Throw on Bait and Switch for the final perk to have the potential setup of a 30 percent damage increase for almost every shot. This then ties in perfectly with the Veist Stinger Origin Trait which can then further Reload the Magazine as the shot count gets lower.

Auto-Loading Holster allows you to switch to another weapon to continue firing another weapon while Faith-Keeper is reloading in the background. Explosive Light is a great damage perk that activate just by picking up Orbs of Power, something that happens often during normal gameplay. Rocket Launchers are notable for being some of the best single-target burst damage in the game. Faith-Keeper is a precision frame, so it does suffer from an overall damage loss compared to other rockets, but it is not a terrible option. Consider it a solid option when you need a void rocket.",

However, if you are set on using it for one reason or another, you’ll want to spec into some of the same things here as in PvE. Once again, we’ll start by going for high velocity with Quick Launch, High-Velocity Rounds, and Impulse Amplifier. Beacon Rounds is also a good substitute here, assuming you can get a kill with the weapon before entering another engagement. The final column is extremely weak, only containing the mediocre picks of Adagio and Surrounded. Beyond these, however, you more than likely won’t even feel the traits in this column working in your gameplay.",

Perk 1 has only two somewhat passable perks: Pulse Monitor and Slice. Pulse Monitor automatically reloads your weapon, which could let you follow up with a second shot if you’re in combat. Slice, on the other hand, will let you lower another guardian’s damage by 15%, keeping you and your teammates alive longer. Perk 2 is also lacking, with Swashbuckler and Deconstruct being the best possible. Swash can net you the swap kill, but only if you hit for max damage. Deconstruct, however, should allow you to put down those pesky Titan barricades while also getting ammo back if done right. Though, based on how it activates, that might be easier said than done.",

Since this doesn’t, we need to get creative on where this can find use. Just as with the PvE roll, we want to ensure the explosion is doing the most damage it can, so run with Quick Launch and High Velocity Rounds. Perk 1 has only two somewhat passable perks: Pulse Monitor and Slice. Pulse Monitor automatically reloads your weapon, which could let you follow up with a second shot if you’re in combat. Slice, on the other hand, will let you lower another guardian’s damage by 15%, keeping you and your teammates alive longer. Perk 2 is also lacking, with Swashbuckler and Deconstruct being the best possible. Swash can net you the swap kill, but only if you hit for max damage. Deconstruct, however, should allow you to put down those pesky Titan barricades while also getting ammo back if done right. Though, based on how it activates, that might be easier said than done.",

Your main focus is on getting Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds together, which gives Claws of the Wolf some serious power in PvE.

So especially when dealing with groups of weak enemies, the combination creates its own feedback loop that makes your killing more effective and your defense even stronger.

The main benefit of Claws of the Wolf is that, while its bullets don't hit too hard, it fires extremely quickly and pretty accurately. Thus, pairing Headseeker, which gives you increased precision damage when you land body shots, and Zen Moment, which increases your aim assist and decreases your flinch the more you land shots, leans into the accuracy Claws of the Wolf already sports. You're firing so many bullets so quickly that you're getting a lot of benefit out of the synergy. Alternatively, To The Pain, a new perk in The Final Shape, gives you a similar benefit when you're under fire, increasing your aim assist as you duel and boosting your handling--great if you need to quickly whip out a shotgun to seal the deal. Zen Moment can also pair with To The Pain, but if you'd prefer a damage perk, Rampage gives you a 10% boost when you land a kill, which can help knock down secondary targets. Kill Clip can be even better--the damage boost is 25% when you reload within three seconds of a kill--but the reload on Claws of the Wolf can be painfully slow, so Rampage's automatic activation might be the better call.",
